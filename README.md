This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.<br>
You can find the most recent version of this guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

Before the first run, install all dependencies:

### `npm install`

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Implementation Hints

The code only provides a minimal but functional skeleton of the application. It does not use any widget library, you're free to choose your own or none at all. The code also is not structured very well, please fix that.

If you don't want to start the server locally, you can also adjust `api.js` and set the backend url to `https://wed3-server.herokuapp.com`.

## Visual Studio Code Setup

The template already contains the configuration for Visual Studio Code. If Flow is used, the corresponding extension `flowtype.flow-for-vscode` needs to be installed. I'd also recommend to install the ESLint plug-in `dbaeumer.vscode-eslint` as well as Prettier `esbenp.prettier-vscode` for automatic formatting.

## Atom Setup

The template already works out of the box with Atom. I'd also recommend to install the `nuclide` package for Flow support as well as `prettier-atom` for automatic formatting.

## WebStorm Setup

WebStorm can also be used to develop React applications. See [this blog post](https://blog.jetbrains.com/webstorm/2016/11/using-flow-in-webstorm/) for setup instructions.
